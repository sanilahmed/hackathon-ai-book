# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Technical Book

A comprehensive educational resource covering ROS 2, Digital Twin simulation, AI-Robot integration, and Vision-Language-Action systems for humanoid robotics.

## Overview

This technical book provides a structured learning path for students, early-career engineers, and developers transitioning from digital AI to physical robotics. The content is organized into 4 educational modules:

1. **ROS 2 Robotic Nervous System** - Foundation for robot communication
2. **Digital Twin (Gazebo + Unity)** - Simulation and visualization
3. **AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)** - Perception and planning
4. **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** - Integration of vision, language, and action

## Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- Basic understanding of robotics concepts
- Familiarity with Python and C++ programming
- At least 16GB RAM (32GB recommended)
- 50GB+ free disk space
