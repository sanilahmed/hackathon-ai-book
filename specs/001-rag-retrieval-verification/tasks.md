# Tasks: RAG Retrieval Pipeline Verification

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-rag-retrieval-verification/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: The examples below include test tasks. Tests are OPTIONAL - only include them if explicitly requested in the feature specification.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Backend**: `backend/` directory for all backend code
- **Verification Module**: `backend/verify_retrieval/` for verification-specific code

<!--
  ============================================================================
  Tasks generated based on spec.md and plan.md for RAG Retrieval Pipeline Verification
  ============================================================================
-->

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [x] T001 Create verification directory structure in backend/verify_retrieval/
- [x] T002 [P] Update pyproject.toml with verification dependencies (qdrant-client, python-dotenv)
- [x] T003 [P] Create .env.example with Qdrant configuration variables
- [x] T004 Create README.md for the verification module

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [x] T005 Create qdrant_client.py with Qdrant connection functions in backend/verify_retrieval/
- [x] T006 [P] Implement environment configuration loading in backend/verify_retrieval/config.py
- [x] T007 [P] Setup logging configuration for the verification application
- [x] T008 Create base data models based on data-model.md in backend/verify_retrieval/models.py
- [x] T009 Setup Qdrant client connection with proper error handling

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Embedding Retrieval Verification (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: Validate that stored vector embeddings can be retrieved using semantic queries to ensure the RAG pipeline is functioning correctly.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by providing sample semantic queries and verifying that the system returns relevant content chunks with appropriate similarity scores.

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [x] T010 [P] [US1] Implement load_qdrant_vectors(collection_name) function in backend/verify_retrieval/qdrant_client.py
- [x] T011 [P] [US1] Implement query_qdrant_for_chunks(query_text, top_k=5) function in backend/verify_retrieval/qdrant_client.py
- [x] T012 [US1] Add proper error handling for Qdrant connection issues
- [x] T013 [US1] Test semantic query functionality with sample book content
- [x] T014 [US1] Implement similarity scoring validation based on success criteria (>0.7)
- [x] T015 [US1] Create sample queries from book content for testing

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Metadata Validation (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Ensure that metadata (URL, title, chunk index) associated with each embedding is correctly stored and accessible.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by retrieving embeddings and verifying that associated metadata fields match the expected values from the original source.

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [x] T016 [P] [US2] Implement validate_metadata_consistency(results) function in backend/verify_retrieval/validators.py
- [x] T017 [P] [US2] Create metadata validation logic for URL, title, and chunk index fields
- [x] T018 [US2] Integrate metadata validation with retrieval functions
- [x] T019 [US2] Test metadata validation with known good and bad data
- [x] T020 [US2] Add metadata validation to verification report generation
- [x] T021 [US2] Validate metadata accuracy meets 100% success criteria

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Pipeline Execution Verification (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Confirm that the entire ingestion pipeline executes without errors and can be repeated reliably.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the complete pipeline and verifying that logs show successful completion without exceptions.

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [x] T022 [P] [US3] Implement run_verification_pipeline() function in backend/verify_retrieval/main.py
- [x] T023 [P] [US3] Create generate_verification_report() function in backend/verify_retrieval/reporters.py
- [x] T024 [US3] Add comprehensive logging for pipeline execution status
- [x] T025 [US3] Implement idempotency checks for repeatable execution
- [x] T026 [US3] Test pipeline execution with multiple runs to verify consistency
- [x] T027 [US3] Add error reporting for any pipeline failures

**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional

---

## Phase 6: Integration and Main Pipeline

**Goal**: Integrate all components into a complete verification pipeline that can be executed as a command-line tool.

- [x] T028 Create main.py with CLI interface for the verification pipeline
- [x] T029 [P] Add command-line argument parsing for configuration options
- [x] T030 Integrate all user stories into single execution flow
- [x] T031 Add comprehensive error handling across the entire pipeline
- [x] T032 Implement progress tracking for the complete verification pipeline
- [x] T033 Test complete pipeline with comprehensive test queries

---

## Phase 7: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories

- [x] T034 [P] Update main README.md with verification usage instructions
- [x] T035 Code cleanup and refactoring
- [x] T036 [P] Add unit tests for core functions in backend/tests/test_verification.py
- [x] T037 Performance optimization for large result set processing
- [x] T038 Security hardening (API key handling, input validation)
- [x] T039 Run quickstart.md validation

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)
- **Integration (Phase 6)**: Depends on all user stories being complete
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on US1 retrieval functionality
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on US1 and US2 functionality

### Within Each User Story

- Core implementation before integration
- Error handling after core functionality
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Models/functions within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members (after foundational phase)

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all components for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Implement load_qdrant_vectors(collection_name) function in backend/verify_retrieval/qdrant_client.py"
Task: "Implement query_qdrant_for_chunks(query_text, top_k=5) function in backend/verify_retrieval/qdrant_client.py"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
5. Complete Integration → Test full pipeline → Deploy/Demo
6. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (after US1 foundation)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (after US1/US2 foundation)
3. Integration and polish phases together
4. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
