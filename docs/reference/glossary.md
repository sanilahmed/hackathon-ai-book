# Glossary

This glossary defines key terms used throughout the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Technical Book.

## A

**Action**: A goal-oriented communication pattern in ROS 2 for long-running tasks with feedback and cancelation capabilities.

**AI Robot Brain**: The intelligent processing unit that handles perception, planning, and decision-making for a robot.

## D

**Digital Twin**: A virtual replica of a physical robot or system that can be used for simulation, testing, and analysis.

## G

**Gazebo**: A 3D simulation environment used for robotics that provides realistic physics and sensor simulation.

## L

**Lab Exercises**: Practical hands-on activities designed to reinforce theoretical concepts with real implementation.

## N

**Node**: An executable that uses ROS to communicate with other processes, forming the basic computational element of ROS.

## R

**ROS 2**: The Robot Operating System version 2, a flexible framework for writing robot software.

**ROS 2 Nervous System**: The communication and coordination infrastructure for robotic systems using ROS 2.

## S

**Service**: A synchronous request/response communication pattern in ROS 2.

## T

**Topic**: An asynchronous publish/subscribe communication pattern in ROS 2.

## U

**URDF**: Unified Robot Description Format, an XML format for representing robot models in ROS.

## V
