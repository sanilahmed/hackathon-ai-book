# Digital Twin Architecture Diagrams

This directory contains architecture diagrams for the Digital Twin module (Module 2) of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book.

## Diagrams

### 1. Digital Twin Architecture Overview
- Shows the integration between Gazebo simulation, Unity visualization, and ROS 2
- Illustrates the data flow between simulation environments and real-time control

### 2. Sensor Simulation Architecture
- Details the sensor pipeline from Gazebo physics simulation to Unity perception
- Shows how sensor data is processed and synchronized

### 3. ROS 2 Bridge Configuration
- Visual representation of topic mappings between Gazebo and ROS 2
- Shows joint state and TF synchronization mechanisms

### 4. Multi-Environment Synchronization
- Demonstrates time synchronization techniques
- Shows how states are maintained across Gazebo, Unity, and ROS 2

## Tools Used

These diagrams were created using:
- Mermaid.js for sequence and flow diagrams
- PlantUML for UML diagrams
- Draw.io for complex architecture diagrams
- Docusaurus integration for documentation

## Usage

To update diagrams, edit the source files and regenerate the visual representations. All diagrams should be accompanied by detailed explanations in the respective documentation pages.
