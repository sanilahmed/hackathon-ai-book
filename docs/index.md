# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Technical Book

Welcome to the comprehensive guide to embodied AI and humanoid robotics. This book covers four essential modules that will take you from basic robotic communication to advanced vision-language-action systems.

## Modules

This book is organized into four comprehensive modules:

### [Module 1: ROS 2 Robotic Nervous System](./modules/ros2-nervous-system/)
Learn the fundamentals of robotic communication and control using ROS 2, including nodes, topics, services, and URDF-based robot descriptions.

### [Module 2: Digital Twin (Gazebo + Unity)](./modules/digital-twin/)
Simulate humanoid robots in virtual environments using Gazebo and Unity with physics-based interactions and sensor simulation.

### [Module 3: AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)](./modules/ai-robot-brain/)
Implement perception, navigation, and manipulation pipelines using NVIDIA Isaac Sim and Isaac ROS.

### [Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)](./modules/vla-system/)
Integrate vision, speech, and LLMs into ROS 2 pipelines for conversational humanoid robots that interpret commands and act autonomously.

## Target Audience

This book is designed for:
- Students in AI/Robotics (intermediate to advanced)
- Early-career engineers learning embodied AI
- Developers transitioning from digital AI to physical robotics

## Getting Started

Begin with [Module 1](./modules/ros2-nervous-system/) to establish the foundational concepts, then progress through each module sequentially to build your understanding of physical AI systems.
