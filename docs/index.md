# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Technical Book

Welcome to the comprehensive guide to embodied AI and humanoid robotics. This book covers everything from basic ROS 2 concepts to advanced AI integration, digital twins, and vision-language-action systems.

## Modules

This book is organized into several modules that build upon each other:

### Module 1: ROS 2 Robotic Nervous System
- Understanding ROS 2 architecture and communication patterns
- Creating nodes, topics, services, and actions
- URDF robot modeling and simulation
- AI integration with ROS 2 systems

### Module 2: Digital Twin (Gazebo + Unity)
- Setting up Gazebo simulation environments
- Unity integration for digital twin capabilities
- Sensor simulation and calibration
- Synchronization between ROS 2 and simulation environments

### Module 3: AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)
- NVIDIA Isaac Sim setup and configuration
- Perception systems and computer vision
- Planning and control algorithms
- Reinforcement learning for robotics

### Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Systems
- Understanding VLA fundamentals and architecture
- Multimodal perception systems
- Language-action mapping for robot interaction
- Training and deploying VLA models

## Getting Started

Begin with Module 1 to establish the foundation of ROS 2 concepts, then progress through each module to build a complete understanding of humanoid robotics systems.

Each module includes:
- Theoretical concepts and practical implementations
- Lab exercises to reinforce learning
- Code examples and best practices
- Integration techniques with other modules

## Target Audience

This book is designed for:
- Robotics engineers and researchers
- AI/ML practitioners working with embodied systems
- Students studying robotics and AI
- Developers building humanoid robot applications
