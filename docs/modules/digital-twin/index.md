# Module 2: Digital Twin (Gazebo + Unity)

This module covers the creation and use of digital twins for humanoid robots using Gazebo and Unity.

## Overview

A digital twin is a virtual replica of a physical robot or system that can be used for:
- Simulation and testing
- Control algorithm development
- Performance optimization
- Safety validation

## Key Components

1. **Gazebo Simulation**: Physics-based simulation environment
2. **Unity Integration**: Realistic visual rendering and user interaction
3. **ROS 2 Bridge**: Synchronization between real and virtual systems
4. **Sensor Simulation**: Virtual sensors that mirror real-world counterparts

## Benefits

- Reduced hardware wear and testing time
- Safe environment for algorithm development
- Ability to test in dangerous or difficult-to-reach scenarios
- Parallel development of hardware and software
