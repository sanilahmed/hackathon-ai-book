# Module 1: ROS 2 Robotic Nervous System

## Overview
This module introduces the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) as the "nervous system" of humanoid robots, providing the communication infrastructure needed for robotic applications.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand ROS 2 architecture and its role as a robotic communication framework
- Create and configure ROS 2 workspaces with proper package structure
- Implement nodes in Python and C++ that communicate via topics and services
- Design humanoid robot models using URDF format
- Integrate AI agents with ROS 2 using `rclpy` client library
