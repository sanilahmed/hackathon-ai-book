# Module 1: ROS 2 Robotic Nervous System

This module covers the ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) framework as the nervous system for humanoid robots.

## Overview

ROS 2 serves as the communication backbone for robotic systems, providing:
- Message passing between nodes
- Services for synchronous communication
- Actions for long-running tasks
- Parameter server for configuration

## Key Concepts

- **Nodes**: Individual processes that communicate with each other
- **Topics**: Publish/subscribe communication channels
- **Services**: Request/response communication patterns
- **Actions**: Goal-based communication for long-running tasks

## Architecture

The ROS 2 architecture includes:
- DDS (Data Distribution Service) for communication
- RMW (ROS Middleware) layer
- Client libraries (rclcpp, rclpy)

## Next Steps

Continue to learn about the ROS 2 architecture, nodes and topics, URDF modeling, and AI integration.
